# library_project

This project was done from the exercise featured in The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

Although one of the demands for this code was to make it so that the user could fill out a form and insert the parameters for a book (author, pages, title...), this current version features a series of prompts that will ask the same questions to the user and fill them out (by default, they have values, but the user can - and should - change the around).

In the future, the form version will be implemented. So far, it works as intended.
